# README
This is a simple blog I created using Ruby on Rails. 

The user has the ability to create and view blog posts. 

Click 'Create Post' on the navigation bar to create a new blog post.

Click 'Home' on the navigation bar to view saved blog posts.

Blog posts can be edited and deleted using the 'Read More' button below each post.
