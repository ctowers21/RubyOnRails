# README

This is a simple blog I created using Ruby on Rails. 

The user has the ability to create and view blog posts. 

Click 'Create Post' on the navigation bar to create a new blog post.

Click 'Home' on the navigation bar to view saved blog posts.

Blog posts can be edited and deleted using the 'Read More' button below each post.

#Starting the Project

1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

 $ gem install rails
2. At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:

 $ rails new myapp
 where "myapp" is the application name.

3. Change directory to myapp and start the web server:

 $ cd myapp
 $ bin/rails server
Run with --help or -h for options.

4. Go to http://localhost:3000 and the project will start.
